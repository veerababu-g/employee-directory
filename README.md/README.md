🛠 How to Run Locally
Option 1: Frontend only (No backend needed)

Open index.ftlh or rename to index.html

Use Live Server Extension

Right-click → Open with Live Server

Option 2: With Freemarker

Set up a minimal Java backend using Freemarker engine (e.g., Spring Boot)

Serve template via controller and pass mock data

🧠 Reflections
Focused on clean UI, smooth UX, and modular JS logic

Built without external libraries to demonstrate core DOM skills

Used semantic HTML5 and responsive CSS for professional layout
